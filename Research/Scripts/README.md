## Note:
I included these just in case. None of them will run now without cosmonaut.com and because the endpoint was closed.
- **makeISO** -- create an ISO and attach cosmonaut.com to it (there was a typo)
- **pwn_crack** -- All this did when I got it to work was send the "help" command to the endpoint and print the output
- **run.yml** -- This is the code I used to run cosmonaut.com on macOS.
